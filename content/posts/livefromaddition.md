## Live From The Addition

Out of the ashes of the Olde Time Radio Hour rises Live From The Addition. The
same great live Dirty Old Ambusher, but now with frequent guests. The show airs
every Wednesday at Midnight (eastern) on 97.1 WXOX out of Louisville KY.





Also streaming worldwide at [artxfm.com](http://artxfm.com) or wherever you get
your internet radio from.
